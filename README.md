# StateMachineBot

Hello! This is my final project for my Embedded Systems course. This project is essentially taking a robot, and controlling it with the LPC804 microcontroller.

The sensors used are an IR remote control, and an ultrasonic sensor.  The bot supports being directly controlled by the remote control, as well as recording and replaying movements.
It also supports replaying movements in reverse and mirrored, so that a single recording can be used to travel back and forth.

Hand gestures can be used to control the bot as well.

A demonstration of my bot in action can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y4A216La6w&feature=youtu.be)
